        <h3>Jenkins Build Light</h3>

<p>A Jenkins build light built using a KMtronic USB controlled relay to control a pair of lights. </p>

<p>This project uses a Maven build and I wrote a separate <a href="http://portingle.github.com/kmtronic/">little library for the KMtronic integration</a> which you need to build first.</p>

<h3>How does it work?</h3>

<p>As far as the electronic are concerned I've opted to use a ready made USB controlled relay to switch the power to my build like. </p>

<h3>What's a KMTronic USB relay?</h3>

<h3>Why KMtronic?</h3>

<p>Using a KMtronic relay is handy if you need simple on/off control and/or if you want the option of controlling higher power loads than a solid state solution would permit. E.g. one could imagine using some second-hand 240v Traffic Lights as a CI signal and that would require a lot of current to drive it; or perhaps you want an annoying flashing desk lamp when the build is broken.</p>

<p>In my case I'm actually controlling a low power lighting setup and the relays are total overkill in that respect, however the convenience of the pre-packaged KMtronic USB/Relay box and the simplicity of integration with my Jenkins monitor software was what motivated me to give it a spin. For fun (or to avoid the annoying clicking relay sound) I may try hooking up an Arduino rather than a KMtronic in future.</p>

<p>By contrast, I have a buddy who uses a power LED for his build light and he wants control of the brightness of the LED, for this he uses Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) to control the brightness of the LED, and so 
a solution like mine doesn't work for him. In his case he has used a Arduino UNO and wired it's PWM pins control a transistor that drives the power LED.
Like mine, his board is powered by the USB connection to the PC and the load on the USB is around 400ma.</p>

<p>If you don't want to use the KMtronic relay approach then note that the KMTronic dependency easily swapped out for some other signalling tech.</p>

<h3>JVM support for the relay?</h3>

<p>KMtronic have a lot of sample code for the relay but nothing for the JVM, so I wrote a small JVM library for it.
You need to build this relay control library before building my JenkinsBuildLight  project. </p>

<p>My relay control lib is available separately here  <a href="http://portingle.github.com/kmtronic/"></a><a href="http://portingle.github.com/kmtronic/">http://portingle.github.com/kmtronic/</a></p>
